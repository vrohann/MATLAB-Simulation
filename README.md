# MATLAB-Simulation
Developed a model on MATLAB to simulate the initiation, interaction, and movements of dislocations on the application
of stress

 Incorporated frank-read mechanism and Cottrell's theory in the model for higher accuracy during interaction

 Assessed the simulated results to check their consistency with theoretical results proving the model to be accurate
